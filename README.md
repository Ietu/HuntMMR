# HuntMMR

pip install -r requirements.txt

Tool to check your MMR in Hunt: Showdown.

Finds all steam installations and then checks them for the path for the attributes.xml file and then looks for the latest MMR attribute and prints it with star rating and how much MMR for next rank

TODO: add some gifs or images for each rank and some additional features if there's something else to rip from hunts files
